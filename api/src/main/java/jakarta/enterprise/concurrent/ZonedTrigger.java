/**
 * Triggers allow application developers to plug in rules for when
 * and how often a task should run. The trigger can be as simple as
 * a single, absolute date-time or can include Jakarta&trade; EE business
 * calendar logic. A trigger implementation is created by the
 * application developer (or may be supplied to the application
 * externally) and is registered with a task when it is submitted
 * to a {@link ManagedScheduledExecutorService} using any of the
 * schedule methods. Each method will run with unspecified context.
 * The methods can be made contextual through creating contextual
 * proxy objects using {@link ContextService}.
 * <p>
 * Each trigger instance will be invoked within the same process
 * in which it was registered.
 * <p>
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#47;**
 *  * A trigger that runs on the hour, Mon-Fri from 8am-8pm Central US time.
 *  *&#47;
 *  public class HourlyDuringBusinessHoursTrigger implements ZonedTrigger {
 *      static final ZoneId ZONE = ZoneId.of("America/Chicago");
 *
 *      public ZoneId getZoneId() {
 *          return ZONE;
 *      }
 *
 *      public ZonedDateTime getNextRunTime(LastExecution lastExec, ZonedDateTime taskScheduledTime) {
 *          ZonedDateTime prevTime = lastExec == null ? taskScheduledTime : lastExec.getRunEnd(ZONE);
 *          ZonedDateTime nextTime = prevTime.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.HOURS).plusHours(1);
 *          DayOfWeek day = nextTime.getDayOfWeek();
 *          if (day.equals(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY) || day.equals(DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)) {
 *              nextTime = nextTime.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.DAYS).plusDays(1).withHour(8);
 *          } else { // Mon-Fri 8am-8pm
 *              int hour = nextTime.getHour();
 *              if (hour{@literal <} 8)
 *                  nextTime = nextTime.plusHours(8 - hour);
 *              else if (hour{@literal >} 20)
 *                  nextTime = nextTime.truncatedTo(ChronoUnit.DAYS)
 *                                     .plusDays(day.equals(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY) ? 3 : 1)
 *                                     .withHour(8);
 *          }
 *          return nextTime;
 *      }
