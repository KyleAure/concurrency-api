/**
 * Annotates a CDI managed bean method to run asynchronously.
 * The CDI managed bean must not be a Jakarta Enterprise Bean,
 * and neither the method nor its class can be annotated with
 * the MicroProfile Asynchronous annotation.
 * <p>
 * The Jakarta EE Product Provider runs the method on a {@link ManagedExecutorService}
 * and returns to the caller a {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture CompletableFuture}
 * that is backed by the same <code>ManagedExecutorService</code>
 * to represent the execution of the method. The <code>ManagedExecutorService</code>
 * is the default asynchronous execution facility for the <code>CompletableFuture</code>
 * and and all dependent stages that are created from those, and so on,
 * as defined by the <code>ManagedExecutorService</code> JavaDoc API.
 * The Jakarta EE Product Provider makes this <code>CompletableFuture</code> available
 * to the asynchronous method implementation via the
 * {@link Result#getFuture Asynchronous.Result.getFuture} and
 * {@link Result#complete Asynchronous.Result.complete} methods.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Asynchronous
 * public CompletableFuture{@literal <Double>} hoursWorked(LocalDate from, LocalDate to) {
 *     // Application component's context is made available to the async method,
 *     try (Connection con = ((DataSource) InitialContext.doLookup(
 *         "java:comp/env/jdbc/timesheetDB")).getConnection()) {
 *         ...
 *         return Asynchronous.Result.complete(total);
 *     } catch (NamingException | SQLException x) {
 *         throw new CompletionException(x);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * with usage,
 *
 * <pre>
 * hoursWorked(mon, fri).thenAccept(total {@literal ->} {
 *     // Application component's context is made available to dependent stage actions,
 *     DataSource ds = InitialContext.doLookup(
 *         "java:comp/env/jdbc/payrollDB");
 *     ...
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * When the asynchronous method implementation returns a different
 * <code>CompletableFuture</code> instance, the Jakarta EE Product Provider
 * uses the completion of that instance to complete the <code>CompletableFuture</code>
 * that the Jakarta EE Product Provider returns to the caller,
 * completing it with the same result or exception.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Asynchronous
 * public CompletableFuture{@literal <List<Itinerary>>} findSingleLayoverFlights(Location source, Location dest) {
 *     try {
 *         ManagedExecutorService executor = InitialContext.doLookup(
 *             "java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService");
 *
 *         return executor.supplyAsync(source::flightsFrom)
 *                        .thenCombine(executor.completedFuture(dest.flightsTo()),
 *                                     Itinerary::sourceMatchingDest);
 *     } catch (NamingException x) {
 *         throw new CompletionException(x);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * with usage,
 *
 * <pre>
 * findSingleLayoverFlights(RST, DEN).thenApply(Itinerary::sortByPrice);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Methods with the following return types can be annotated to be
 * asynchronous methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture CompletableFuture}</li>
 * <li>{@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage CompletionStage}</li>
 * <li><code>void</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The Jakarta EE Product Provider raises
 * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException}
 * if other return types are used or if the annotation is placed at the class
 * level. The injection target of <code>ElementType.TYPE</code> is to be used only
 * by the CDI extension that is implemented by the Jakarta EE Product Provider to
 * register the asynchronous method interceptor. Applications must only use the
 * asynchronous method annotation at method level.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions that are raised by asynchronous methods are not raised directly
 * to the caller because the method runs asynchronously to the caller.
 * Instead, the <code>CompletableFuture</code> that represents the result
 * is completed with the raised exception. Asynchronous methods are
 * discouraged from raising checked exceptions because checked exceptions
 * force the caller to write exception handling code that is unreachable.
 * When a checked exception occurs, the asynchronous method implementation
 * can flow the exception back to the resulting <code>CompletableFuture</code>
 * either by raising a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionException CompletionException}
 * with the original exception as the cause, or it can take the equivalent
 * approach of exceptionally completing the <code>CompletableFuture</code>, using
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture#completeExceptionally completeExceptionally}
 * to supply the original exception as the cause.
 * <p>
 * Except where otherwise stated, the Jakarta EE Product Provider raises
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException RejectedExecutionException}
 * upon invocation of the asynchronous method if evident upfront that it cannot
 * be accepted, for example if the JNDI name is not valid or points to something
 * other than a managed executor resource. If determined at a later point that the
 * asynchronous method cannot run (for example, if unable to establish thread context),
 * then the Jakarta EE Product Provider completes the <code>CompletableFuture</code>
 * exceptionally with {@link java.util.concurrent.CancellationException CancellationException},
 * and chains a cause exception if there is any.
 * <p>
 * The Jakarta EE Product Provider must assign the interceptor for asynchronous methods
 * to have priority of <code>Interceptor.Priority.PLATFORM_BEFORE + 5</code>.
 * Interceptors with a lower priority, such as <code>Transactional</code>, must run on
 * the thread where the asynchronous method executes, rather than on the submitting thread.
 * When an asynchronous method is annotated as <code>Transactional</code>,
 * the transactional types which can be used are:
 * <code>TxType.REQUIRES_NEW</code>, which causes the method to run in a new transaction, and
 * <code>TxType.NOT_SUPPORTED</code>, which causes the method to run with no transaction.
 * All other transaction attributes must result in
 * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException}
 * upon invocation of the asynchronous method.
 *
 * @since 3.0
 */
// TODO the above restrictions on Transactional interceptors could be eliminated
// if transaction context propagation is later added to the spec.

     * <p>Establishes a schedule for repeated execution of the method.
     * A single future represents the completion of all executions in the schedule.
     * The Jakarta EE product attempts to run the method at the scheduled times
     * until its future is completed or the method returns a non-null result value
     * or raises an exception. The future is always accessible from within the method via
     * {@code Asynchronous.Result} which returns a typed {@code CompletableFuture} which matches the return
     * type of the method. If the method return type is {@code void} then {@code Asynchronous.Result}
     * will return a {@code CompletableFuture<Void>}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Computation of the start time for the next execution occurs
     * after the completion of the current execution. This prevents overlap
     * of executions from the same asynchronous method request. Scheduled
     * execution times that overlap a prior execution that is still running
     * are skipped. For example, if an asynchronous method is scheduled to
     * run every minute on the minute and execution of the method starts at
     * 8:00 AM, lasting for 2 minutes and 10 seconds, then the Jakarta EE product
     * attempts to start the next execution of the method at 8:03 AM.</p>
